Recently, I've been trying out the ridiculously nice [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator/) typeface in [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) and [Atom](https://atom.io).

**TL/DR: it's amazing.**

As you can see, the italic style is strikingly different—I've been toying with using this style for tag labels, and when templating with Liquid I find it actually works rather well. Now, let's be clear: **spending $180 on a typeface for your text editor is pretty close to the height of privilege**. When my free trial runs out, I doubt I'll buy it outright—but if I _was_ going to throw around cash like that on typefaces, Operator Mono would be at the top of the list.
