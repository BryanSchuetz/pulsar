  Mostly, I feel like time is flowing way to fast—I just want to slow things down. There is one context though—where things couldn't go fast enough. So I built a little Raycast extension to show me this particular countdown whenever I toggle the window open.

I have two small kids, so I think about time a lot. Not just in the sense of how long it takes them to brush their teeth in the morning, or how much time I have to get stuff done before school gets out. But also in that cliche way where you wake up one day and they seem so much older than they were just the day before. "The days go by like years—and the years go by like days", it has been said. It's a platitude, but that doesn't make it untrue. The flow of time somehow feels differently across contexts.

Most of the time I'm very focused on how fast time is going, and how much I want to slow it down. In my journal I have a grid of my life in weeks (based on average life expectancy). It's meant to inspire me to make the most out of the time I have—really it just stresses me the hell out. When I think about my family, or my job, or myself, I really just want time to SLOW THE HELL DOWN.

**There's atleast one context though**—where I feel like things couldn't go fast enough. And when I realize how much time has already ticked off the clock for this particular countdown, it instantly makes me feel better. So I made this little Raycast extension that shows up whenever I toggle the window open.

      Everytime I toggle Raycast open I see this little progress bar.

I think it's the little things that will help us make it through.
