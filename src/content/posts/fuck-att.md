> The wife and I recently upgraded our iPhones **through Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program**â€”_has not a thing in the world to do with AT&T_. Yet, @ATT somehow got up the gall to charge us each a $20 upgrade feeâ€”WTF!?! One support call later, they've credited us for the cost of the feeâ€”but how many people didn't notice, or didn't bother to complain. For charging me $40 while "layin in the cut"â€”watching me move my SIM card from one phone I own, to another phone I'm paying a third party to ownâ€”@ATT wins my coveted "dick of the month" award: ðŸ–• Thanks for playing.
