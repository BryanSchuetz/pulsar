At this point, talking about keyboards seems a bit cliché. Still, like the hipster who was a fan of that band before they made it big and sold out—I do feel compelled to pull out my recipts and say a few things on the subject.

As a child of the 80s, I grew up with some [cool keyboards](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Radio_Shack_TRS-80_Model_I). The caps were tall and shiny, the layouts were odd, and the cases were loud and full of echo. When I landed my first real job out of grad school—I had a modern take on the [AEK II](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Matias_Tactile_Pro) and it was all I needed (2003). By the time [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-code-keyboard/) announced he was working with WASD to build the ultimate TKL (2013), it was an instabuy for me—and I started to think about things like plate material, dye-sublimation. 

A couple years later I was on Geekhack, then on the MK subreddit—I got into [40s](https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/kumo), and finally learned how to build my own keyboard firmware with [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). In retrospect, this was the tipping point. I mean, I do like nice keyboards.
