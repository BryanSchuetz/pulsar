There’s not much that brings a smile to my face with greater ease than just staring at cool looking clouds. Maybe it’s a fundamental appeal to my lazy aspect, maybe it’s a spiritual connection to the true nature of things, who knows. Either way, snapping this after a near miss with an imposing thunderstorm was worth a few smiles.
