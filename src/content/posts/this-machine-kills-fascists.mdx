I finally got around to re-building my BauerLite 0 with the new Dynacap EC switches. Unlike traditional mechanical switches EC switches activate by detecting changes in electrical charge, or capacitance, without physical metal contact points. I first tried EC/Topre switches when I had an [HHKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard) 8+ years ago. They got to me good—as did the split backspace, swaps for Ctrl/CapsLock, and Pipe/Backsp. But, I was never really a fan of the iconic bottom row. Since then, custom Topre has become a real thing—thanks to Cipulot's PCBs and now Clever/Omnitype Dynacap gear. Now I can have that Topre feel in [The Blessed Layout](https://distresssignal.org/keyboards/).
